This folder contains all the code used to construct a surrogate model for the pricing function using L2 random projection: 

- All code used to perform the L2 projection is in the file L2_projection.py. 
- The total_product.py file contains the necessary code to construct polynomial bases using total degree and total product 
  index sets. 
- The implementation of MLMC methods to generate training data is provided in mlmc_pricing.py 

All of the files above are called within pricing_L2.py, which constructs and analyses surrogate models for the pricing problem
using L2 projection. In particular, this file produces the output seen in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2 & 4.3 of the report. As
remarked in the report, it can take several hours for this file to generate the 12000 training points used to fit the model. 
To save time, the training data (X, prices) can be downloaded and imported into python from X.npy, prices.npy respectively. 
Similarly, the test data can be downloaded from X_test.npy, prices_test.npy. The generation of training and test data can then 
be omitted from pricing_L2.py.
NOTE: All files must be downloaded and stored in the same folder to work.
