This folder contains all the code used to construct a surrogate model for the pricing function using L2 random projection: 

- All code used to perform the L2 projection is in the file L2_projection.py. 
- The total_product.py file contains the necessary code to construct polynomial bases using total degree and total product 
  index sets. 
- The implementation of MLMC methods to generate training data is provided in mlmc_pricing.py 

All of the files above are called within pricing_L2.py, which constructs and analyses surrogate models for the pricing problem
using L2 projection. In particular, this file produces the output seen in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2 & 4.3 of the report. As
remarked in the report, it can take several hours for this file to generate the 12000 training points used to fit the model.
