This folder contains all the code used to construct a surrogate model for the pricing function using L2 random projection. 
All code used to perform the L2 projection is in the file L2_projection.py. The total_product.py file contains the necessary
code to construct polynomial bases using total degree and total product index sets. The construction and analysis of surrogate
models for the pricing problem is presented in pricing_L2.py, which uses the code from the files above, and that within 
mlmc_pricing.py - which uses MLMC methods to generate training data.
