- This folder contain all the code for the performance testing of multilevel Monte Carlo for simulation of the Black-karasinski model.
- The main function is defined as 'mlmc', which calls the function 'mlmc_l' at each level $l$
- Then test is performed on a set of parameters and the codes generate Figure $2.1$-$2.3$ in the report
