This folder contains all the code necessary to implement GP regression for the pricing function, P. To run the code: download
all files to the same folder, change line 18 of GPfromData2.py to have the correct filepath to run GPonline.py, then run
GPfromData2.py. The .npy files in this folder are training data corresponding to the data given in Table 3.1 in:
https://www.overleaf.com/read/yqghysfrsqnq.

Note: this implementation makes use of the file pysg.py (which generates sparse grids), created by Jochan Garcke, which is freely available and can be found
at https://github.com/jgarcke/sparse-grid-py.
