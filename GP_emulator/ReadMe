This folder contains all the code necessary to implement GP regression for the pricing function, P. To run the code: download
all files to the same folder, change line 18 of GPfromData2.py to have the correct filepath to run GPonline.py, then run
GPfromData2.py.

Note: this implementation makes use of the file pysg.py (which generates sparse grids), created by Jochan Garcke, which is freely available and can be found
at https://github.com/jgarcke/sparse-grid-py.
